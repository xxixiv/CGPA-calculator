A simple progam in python that can be used in Tetiary instituitions to calculate:
	1. Grade Point(GP)
	2. Cummulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)
It uses a database to store the values of each course point then print out an output of the overall.
I would love if this Project could be developed further. Hence the code is open-sourced.
